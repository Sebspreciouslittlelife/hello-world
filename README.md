# hello-world

Hello, All!

I'm a uber novice programmer with a background in Java.  I learned Java through an online class, so it was a little bit like the computer was teaching me how to speak its language.  

I love the idea of connecting code and art, as well as interpreting real life situations in a computer based language and vice versa.

Cheers'
